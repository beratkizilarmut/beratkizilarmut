Hi, I’m @beratkizilarmut
I’m interested in Embedded Systems.

Currently working at TÜBİTAK BİLGEM GzIS RTOS Project as an Embedded Software Engineer.
Experienced in development on PowerPC, x86 and ARM ISAs.
Graduated from Gebze Technical University Electronics Engineering in 2022.

I’m looking to collaborate on improving myself on FPGA Systems and Embedded Linux solutions.
