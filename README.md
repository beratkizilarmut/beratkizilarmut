Hi, I’m @beratkizilarmut
I’m interested in Embedded Systems.

Graduated from Gebze Technical University Electronics Engineering in 2022.
Currently working at TÜBİTAK BİLGEM GzIS RTOS Project.
Experienced in development on PowerPC, x86 and ARM ISAs.

I’m looking to collaborate on improving myself on FPGA Systems, UNIX based systems and Embedded Linux solutions.
